‚ú® Recent Updates
This iteration brings significant enhancements to user experience and functionality:

Enhanced "Workout Split" and "Pain Level" Fields:

Selected options now appear as visually distinct chips directly within the input fields.

"Workout Split" chips display with unique colors for better differentiation.

"Pain Level" chips use a gradient of colors (green to red) to visually represent intensity.

Both fields maintain a consistent minimum width even when no value is selected, preventing visual inconsistencies.

"Filter & Sort" Section Improvements:

The "Filter Workout" field now also displays the selected workout as a colored chip.

Improved visual handling of empty select fields for better aesthetics.

Application Footer: A subtle footer has been added at the bottom of the application for attribution, including a hyperlink to the developer's portfolio.
